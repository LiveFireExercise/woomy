# Woomy
Woomy is a all-purpose discord bot built off the [guidebot](https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/guidebot) base and coded in node.js using discord.js.

# Notice
Woomy v1 (this repository) is currently only being maintained. Bugs and issues will be fixed if they come up, but no new features will be added. Pull requests that add new features to Woomy should instead be contributed to the version 2 codebase, found [here](https://github.com/woomyware/v2).

When Woomy v2 is released, Woomy v1 will no longer be maintained.

# How to use
The easiest way to use Woomy is to invite it to your server with [this link.](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=435961704145485835&permissions=2134240503&scope=bot) It is hosted 24/7 and automatically updates itself when a new release is made available, making sure you always get the newest features.

You can also self-host! Some modifications to the code will need to be made before Woomy will run on your machine, but anyone who can read errors will figure out what needs to be changed pretty quickly :P
